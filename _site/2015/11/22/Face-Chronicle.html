<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If you were to click a picture of yourself everyday, and see a rolling movie of yourself through a month.. What do you think you’ll see ?
Your very own face chronical helps you give that feedback to yourself about whats really going on with your body. The face tells it all.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Gaining weight? Working out and losing it? Stressing yourself? You may know it, but when you see that feedback, you tend to register it and unconciously correct yourself.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Suspect someone uses your laptop ?
If someone does. You have a record of it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And at the end of it.. It might just be fun :)</p>

  <li>Decompress it if you have to using
      tar -xvf ~/Downloads/ImageSnap-v0.2.5.tgz</li>

  <li>Double click the event created (Untitled) to edit it.</li>
  <li>Add a power on trigger. <img src="https://www.dssw.co.uk/blog/2014-10-09-run-script-on-mac-power-on-or-wake/4-power-manager-power-on-trigger.png" alt="Power on" /></li>
  <li>Add a Run Script &gt; Shell Script action</li>
  <li>Edit the Run Script step by clicking on the <strong>Cog</strong> icon.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Copy and paste the following script.</p>

    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge"><span class="c">#!/bin/sh</span></code></p>

    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">cd ~/Downloads/ImageSnap-v0.2.5;</code>
  <code class="highlighter-rouge">mkdir daily_pics;</code>
  <code class="highlighter-rouge">[ -f ./daily_pics/</code>date “+%d_%m_%Y”<code class="highlighter-rouge">.png ] &amp;&amp; echo "File exists" || ./ImageSnap ./daily_pics/</code>date “+%d_%m_%Y”<code class="highlighter-rouge">.png -w 5;</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>Save and restart.
   Congratulations! Every time you open your computer, you’ll see a green light turn up. Look up and Smile :)</li>
  <li>In gist.. The above makes a directory called daily_pic under the <code class="highlighter-rouge">~/Downloads/ImageSnap-v0.2.5</code> directory. You can always attach that folder to a google drive link and sync it up on the cloud.
(you will probably need to symlink your drive folder to the daily_pic folder.)</li>
</ol>
